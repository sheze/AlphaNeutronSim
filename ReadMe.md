	Under this directory, you will find two methods to calculate the energy spectra of ($\alpha$, n) interaction in concrete. The first one was originally wriiten by Weihe Zeng and i rewrited it following the conventions. While the latter Geant4 simulation is achieved by myself.

## Why i rewrited it and then gave up
1. Although the numerous calculations have been achieved by Weihe Zeng, he paid little attention to the reusability, which leads to inconvenience.
2. When i rewrited it, i realized that it is not achievable since the libraries were generated manually :sob: !!!!! Which made the management and updates more complicated!
3. Well, here comes a good news :happy:! A literature said that Geant4 can be used to simulate this process if you manifest the libraries accurately !
> Neutron production induced by $\alpha$-decay with Geant4, arXiv :[1906.03903](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03903).

## I decided to simulate it with Geant4 finally!
